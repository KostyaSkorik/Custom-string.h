# String.h

## As part of this group project, my friend and I partially implemented a library for working with strings "string.h" in the C language.

## At the beginning of the work, we separated the functions that each of us had to implement (except sprintf), and then together we started implementing sprintf(). In the process, we created our own structure for storing specifiers and made full use of pointers in the C language.

## After completing the implementation, we wrote Unit tests for each function using the check library.h" and prepared a report using gcov_report, which demonstrated 80% test coverage of our functions.
